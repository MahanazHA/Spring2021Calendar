# Spring2021Calendar

This is a calendar that I made for myself for Spring 2021 semester on the Notability App (or any other app you want that it works on).

It is intended to be used with the *Black Paper Setting*. It is best used with the dotted paper style and with Notability's dark theme.

This is simply a compilation of screenshots of Apple's calendar, with the default events colored over to provide a blank calendar.
